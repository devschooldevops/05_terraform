## Legend
A few explanations of weird cloud acronyms

- rg = resource group
(A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases and storage accounts are deployed and managed)

- nic = network interface card
A network interface (NIC) enables an Azure virtual machine (VM) to communicate with internet, Azure, and on-premises resources

- nsg = network security group (a.k.a cloud firewall)
A collection of security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources

- IaC = Infrastructure as code:  is the process of managing and provisioning computer data center resources through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.[1] The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system, rather than maintaining the code through manual processes. The code in the definition files may use either scripts or declarative definitions, but IaC more often employs declarative approaches
